## Hello, I am Ganiu Akowanu ðŸ‘‹,

I am an astuteðŸ˜„ Software Engineer with a huge focus on Backend Development, I pay keen attention to details and make meaningful sense off them.

Currently, a Backend engineer at [ERA](https://emergencyresponseafrica.com). My full work history can be found [here](https://linkedin.com/in/ganiu-akowanu-431a59185).

I have gathered hands-on experience working in full-time and freelancing roles in a number of companies remotely and on site. I have acquired skills in most phases of software development including professional experience with industry best practices(Git Flow, Pair Programming, OOP, SOLID, MVC, TDD) and mastering mainstream technologies in web development(NodeJs, Python, React/Redux, JavaScript(ES6), SQL and ORMs) by building real-world projects.

Talk about Software Development and a problem solver, I am your sure guy ðŸ‘¯ ... I am CODE-ADDICT ðŸ˜„.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with dedicated engineers who are into building realtime solutions to immediate problems

I like to see my self as a Programmer or a Full-stack developer with a mixture of other stuff. However, I am much more comfortable working on stuff on the backend.

Whenever I'm not on my laptop coding, I am listening to Quranic recitations, discussing with friends or exploring nature by talking a walk down the street.

Have a little something you want to talk to me about? [Send a mail](mailto:ganiu.akowanu@gmail.com)
